## Acknowledgements

I'm grateful to my employers for trusting me to lead the team that built the GPU supercompute platform/infrastructure and to co-lead the team doing LLM pre-training. This allowed me to work on large on-premise GPU compute clusters with A100s and then H100s/H200s, which is certainly a privilege. Hopefully sharing some of these notes and insights helps the community.
