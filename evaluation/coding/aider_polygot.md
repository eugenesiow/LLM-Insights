# Aider Polygot

Aider's polyglot benchmark is based on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) coding exercises. Aider is an open source AI pair-programming assistant in the terminal while Exercism is an independent, community funded, not-for-profit organisation that helps people learn and master programming for free.

The polyglot benchmark contains coding problems in C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python and Rust. It focuses on the most difficult 225 exercises out of the 697 that Exercism provides for those languages.
