# TruthfulQA

TruthfulQA was developed by Lin et al. from the University of Oxford and OpenAI and was published in the paper [TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958) in Sep 2021 to May 2022. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. The questions were crafted such that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception, hence, models need to avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts to do well in the benchmark. Hence, the benchmark tests the models factuality capability.
