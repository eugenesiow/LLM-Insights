# MMMLU

The [MMLU](../general/mmlu.md) is a widely recognized benchmark of general knowledge attained by AI models. It covers a broad range of topics from 57 different categories, covering elementary-level knowledge up to advanced professional subjects like law, physics, history, and computer science.

The Multilingual Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMMLU) is a translation of the MMLU test set into 14 languages using professional human translators. Relying on human translators for this evaluation increases confidence in the accuracy of the translations, especially for low-resource languages like Yoruba. 

## Languages
