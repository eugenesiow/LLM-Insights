# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is what I'd describe as a middleware layer, a standardized integration layer, for agents. It is not itself an "agent framework". Rather, MCP provides agents with (standardized, secure and structured) plumbing to connect and perform actions involving external data or tools.
