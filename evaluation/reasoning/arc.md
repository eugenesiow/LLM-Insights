# ARC

The [AI2's Reasoning Challenge (ARC)](https://allenai.org/data/arc) dataset is a multiple-choice question-answering dataset, containing questions from science exams from grade 3 to grade 9. The dataset is split in two partitions: Easy (ARC_e) and Challenge (ARC_c), where the latter partition contains the more difficult questions that require reasoning. Most of the questions have 4 answer choices, with <1% of all the questions having either 3 or 5 answer choices.
