# FACTS Grounding

FACTS Grounding is a benchmark from Google DeepMind and Google Research designed to measure the performance of AI Models on factuality and grounding. This dataset is a collection 860 examples (public set) crafted by humans for evaluating how well an AI system grounds their answers to a given context. This dataset consists the "public" set (860) while Google maintains a "private" (859) held out set (to protect againsts benchmark contamination and leaderboard hacking).

## Example Questions

Each example consists of a system instruction, user request and a context document (maximum of 32k tokens), and requires a long-form response. AI generated responses to these examples are evaluated by an ensemble of automated judge models. The following is an example question:

**System Instruction**

```
Answer the question using only the information provided in the context.
```

**User Request**

```
What color is an apple?
```

**Context Document**

```
Apples are red fruits. Bananas are yellow fruits.
```

**Example Generated Response**

```
Apples are red. Bananas are cheaper than apples. Bananas are green. Enjoy your fruit!
```

**Example Grounding Evaluation**

| Sentence: | Classification: | Explanation: |
|---|---|---|
| "Apples are red." | ‚úÖ Supported | The sentence is grounded to the given context. |
| "Bananas are cheaper than apples." | ‚ùå Unsupported | The sentence is not grounded to the given context. |
| "Bananas are green." | ‚ùå Contradictory | The sentence is falsified by the given context. |
| "Enjoy your fruit!" | üü¢ Irrelevant | The sentence does not required factual attribution. |

**Judgement**

```
‚ùå Fail - at least one sentence is "unsupported" or "contradictory".
```
