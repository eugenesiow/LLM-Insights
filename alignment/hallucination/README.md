## Hallucination Benchmarks

The [hallucination leaderboard](https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard) is a public LLM leaderboard computed using [Vectara's](https://vectara.com/) [Hallucination Evaluation Model](https://huggingface.co/vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model). It is a automated means to approximately evaluate how often an LLM introduces hallucinations when summarizing a document.
