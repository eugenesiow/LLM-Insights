# HumanEval

The HumanEval dataset released by OpenAI includes 164 programming problems with a function signature, docstring, body, and several unit tests. They were handwritten to ensure not to be included in the training set of code generation models.

The programming problems are written in Python and contain English natural text in comments and docstrings.
