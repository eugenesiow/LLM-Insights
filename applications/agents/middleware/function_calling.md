# Function Calling

The following example is a function calling flow (from OpenAI's [function calling API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) but largely the standard for tool use/function calling) between a developer and a model which is given access to tools (functions). The developer executes the function code, sends back the results, and the model will incorporate them into its final response.

    participant Model

    Developer->>Model: 1. Tool Definitions + Messages<br>get_weather(location)<br>What's the weather in Paris?
    Model-->>Developer: 2. Tool Calls<br>get_weather("paris")
    Note over Developer: 3. Execute Function Code<br>get_weather("paris")
    Note over Developer: Result: {"temperature": 14}
    Developer->>Model: 4. Results<br>All Prior Messages<br>{"temperature": 14}
    Model-->>Developer: 5. Final Response<br>It's currently 14Â°C in Paris.
